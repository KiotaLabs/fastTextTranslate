# fastTextTranslate
#### Chinese to English translation engine using Facebook's FastText library
This space is meant for deep learning enthusiasts with varying levels of technical understanding to explore what all they need to cover before they get confident with deep learning. 

The problem at hand is language translation. An introduction to the field can be found in this [excellent write up](https://medium.com/@ageitgey/machine-learning-is-fun-part-5-language-translation-with-deep-learning-and-the-magic-of-sequences-2ace0acca0aa). 
This article will help you appreciate the role of **recurrent neural networks for sequence to sequence translation**. 

Next we would need a good open source implementation for the same. Luckily we got a [Tensorflow tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/seq2seq) for that.

#### Roadmap
We start with the above tutorial, understand the process in detail, and then replace the parts where we can use representations from Facebook's [FastText](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastText) library. As of this moment, the efficacy of this approach has not been validated.
